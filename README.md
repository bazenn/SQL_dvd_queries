# SQL DVD Queries Project

This is a repo of my SQL project where I practice various SQL queries using the dvdrental database. The dvdrental database is a sample database from the SQL - From Zero to Hero course on Udemy. It contains fictional data about a DVD rental store.

## Database Schema

The dvdrental database consists of 15 tables: actor, film, film_actor, category, film_category, store, inventory, rental, payment, staff, customer, address, city, country, and language.


## Queries

In this project, I wrote SQL queries to answer various questions about the DVD rental business. 
The queries in this project cover a wide range of SQL concepts, including:

- Basic SELECT statements
- Filtering and sorting data
- Joins and subqueries
- Aggregation functions
- Window functions
- Advanced data manipulation

The queries are organized in ascending order of complexity, from basic queries using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses, to advanced queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries. You can find the queries and the results in the queries folder.

## How to Run the Queries

To run the queries, you can follow these steps:

**Load the Database:**

    - Use a PostgreSQL database.
    - Load the `dvdrental.tar` file into your PostgreSQL database.
    - Download the .sql file and open it into your query.
